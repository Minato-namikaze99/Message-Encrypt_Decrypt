# Message-Encrypt_Decrypt
This is a project that I made to encrypt and decrypt messages using Python, TKinter and PYBase 64

> P.S. I would recommend running this program in a Virtual Environment to avoid the issue of collision between various modules. You can take a look at [this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-virtual-environment/) article to manage Virtual Environments. 

To run this, you only need to install 1 additional module, which can be installed using the following command:

`
pip install pybase64
`


Now, run the program!
> For now, the passkey has been hardcoded in the Python file.
